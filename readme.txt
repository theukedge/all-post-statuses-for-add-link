Adds all post statuses to the "Add Link" modal in the editor, allowing you to link to future content, draft posts, private items etc.

== Description ==

**Like this plugin?** Consider [leaving a quick review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/all-post-statuses-for-add-link "Review All Post Statuses for Add Link") or writing about how you've used it on your site - [send me a link](https://www.theukedge.com/contact/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=contact "Contact Dave") to that write up if you do.

This plugin is maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/theukedge/all-post-statuses-for-add-link), so feel free to use the repository for reporting issues, submitting feature requests and submitting pull requests.

This simple plugin changes the default behaviour of the "Add Link" modal window, which typically only shows published content, by expanding it to include posts with any post status, allowing you to link to scheduled content, draft content, private content and posts with custom post statuses, like Pitches created by a plugin like [Edit Flow](https://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/).

Just because this allows you to link to the content, this does not mean that the content is necessarily published, nor will it publish unpublished content. Use only when you know the status of each post that you're linking to, to avoid broken links.
